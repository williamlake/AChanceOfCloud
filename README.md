Simple API that exposes two Weather webservices via REST interfaces

The Filesystem can be imported into Anypoint Studio via the Import Anypoint Studio Project From File System option. Ensure the Filesystem is placed
within your Anypoint Studio workspace.

The RAML API Specification Files can be found within \src\main\resources\api. 

This implementation relies on the Weather Exercie docker file running on port 8080. 

The Two interfaces are accessible on http://localhost:8081/api/cities and http://localhost:8081/api/weather while the Anypoint Studio Project is running
